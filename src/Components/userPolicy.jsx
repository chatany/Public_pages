            Notwithstanding our Risk Disclosure Statement available at:
            www.BitZup.com to further your understanding of the risks associated
            with trading in Digital Assets, BitZup hereby reminds you of the
            following:
          </div>
          <div>
            YOU MUST FULLY UNDERSTAND AND ASSESS THE RISKS IN DIGITAL ASSETS
            TRADING BEFORE CONDUCTING ANY TRADING ACTIVITIES OR USING OUR
            SERVICES; YOU MUST ASSESS YOUR RISK TOLERANCE CAREFULLY BEFORE
            ENGAGING IN DIGITAL ASSETS TRADINGS. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
            when using our Services, you may face risks regarding policy,
            regulatory compliance, investment yield, trading, and force majeure,
            etc, the non-exhaustive details of which are as follows:
          </div>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 leading-8 space-y-2">
            <li>
              (a) POLICY RISK: Users of BitZup may encounter losses due to the
              amendment of national laws, regulations or macro-policies which
              may influence the normal trade of Digital Assets.
            </li>
            <li>
              (b) COMPLIANCE RISK: Users of BitZup may encounter losses if the
              User’s Digital Assets trade violates national laws or regulations
            </li>
            <li>
              (c) INVESTMENT YIELD RISK: the Digital Asset market has its
              uniqueness: it never closes, with Digital Assets prices
              fluctuating in a very wide range. Users may encounter losses in
              the market.
            </li>
            <li>
              (d) TRADING RISK: Your successful transfer is dependent on mutual
              assent of the parties to the transfer and BitZup does not commit
              to or guarantee any successful transfer.
            </li>
            <li>
              (e) FORCE MAJEURE RISK: When natural disasters, war, strikes,
              cyber-attacks and other unpredictable, unavoidable and
              unformidable situations occur, BitZup may not be able to operate
              normally and this may result in users' losses. For the User’s
              losses caused by force majeure, BitZup will not assume any civil
              liabilities
            </li>
            <li>
              (f) RISK OF DELISTING: When a Digital Assets project party faces
              bankruptcy, liquidation and dissolution, or violates national laws
              & regulations, or under the request of the project party, BitZup
              will delist such Digital Assets, which may cause losses for Users.
            </li>
            <li>
              (g) TECHNICAL RISK: Although the chance of technical fault is
              remote during the Digital Assets trade, we cannot exclude such
              possibility. If such has happened, the User’s interests may be
              affected.
            </li>
            <li>
              (h) OPERATIONS RISK: Users may face risks due to operational
              error, such as transfers to wrong accounts, violations in
              operation regulations, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              (i) RISK OF ACCOUNT BEING FROZEN: User’s account may be frozen or
              forcefully confiscated by judicial institutions in the event of
              debt fraud or alleged crimes.

            at any specific time, nor does it ensure that the platform will be
            free from unexpected outages or network congestion. As a result,
            there may be times when you are unable to buy, sell, store,
            transfer, send, or receive Digital Assets as intended. In cases
            where a Digital Asset project undergoes bankruptcy, liquidation, or
            dissolution, violates applicable laws and regulations, or if
            requested by the project party, BitZup may delist the associated
            Digital Asset. Such actions could lead to potential losses for
            Users. Due to legal and regulatory constraints in various
            jurisdictions, certain BitZup products, services, or platform
            functionalities may be restricted or unavailable in specific regions

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 leading-[32px] space-y-2">
            <li>
              (a) User accounts: a User account will be generated upon a User’s
              registration with BitZup. The User account will record the User's
              activities on the Platform. The aforementioned User account shall
              be the sole account for the User to log on to BitZup and use any
              Services thereon.
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
              (d) Updating trading status: The User confirms that the digital
              asset trading status confirmed by the User in accordance with
              BitZup services procedures on BitZup will become an irrevocable
              instruction for BitZup to conduct relevant transactions or
              operations for the User. The User agrees that the execution time
              of relevant instructions shall be based on the actual operation
              time of BitZup in the BitZup system. The User agrees that BitZup
              has the right to handle relevant matters in accordance with this
              Agreement and/or the relevant dispute resolution rules of BitZup.
              Any dispute or loss caused by User’s failure to amend or confirm
              the transaction status, or to submit relevant applications in a
              timely manner, shall be borne by the User exclusively, and BitZup

              seller participating in the transaction of digital asset
              transactions itself, and that BitZup does not provide, by itself,
              any services relating to the deposit or withdrawal of the legal
              tender of any country.
            </li>

              (f) Transaction inquiry: BitZup will record all of the User's
              operations on BitZup, regardless of whether the purpose of such
              operations is finally achieved. The User can query such
              transaction records under the User’s account in real time via User
              Account.
            </li>
            <li>
              (g) Transaction security settings: BitZup has the right to carry
              out the settings of transaction-related matters from time to time
              based on considerations of such factors as transaction security,
              including transaction limits and transaction times, inter alia.
              The Users understand that the aforesaid settings of BitZup may
              cause certain inconveniences in trading, and the Users have no
              objection thereto.

              error caused by a system failure or any other reason, BitZup has
              the right to correct the error regardless of whether it is
              beneficial to BitZup or its Users. Where due to such error, the
              User actually receives more digital assets than the amount that
              such User should have received, then regardless of the nature and
              reason of the error, BitZup reserves the right to correct such
              improperly executed transaction and the User shall return the
              overcharged digital assets or perform other operations in
              accordance with the specific requirements of BitZup's notice to
              the User regarding the correction of such error. The User
              understands and agrees that BitZup will not assume any losses or
              responsibilities caused by the aforesaid handling error.
