            The objective of this Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money
            Laundering/CounterTerrorism Financing (AML/CFT) Policy is to
            establish a robust and comprehensive framework that effectively
            prevents the use of the BitZup platform for illicit financial
            activities, including but not limited to money laundering, terrorism
            financing, proliferation financing, and any other criminal conduct
            as defined under the laws of Trinidad and Tobago, such as the
            Proceeds of Crime Act, Anti-Terrorism Act, and relevant directives
            from the relevant authorities. This policy is designed to ensure
            that the company implements rigorous procedures for the
            identification, verification, monitoring, and reporting of users and
            transactions. It further aims to raise awareness among all
            employees, officers, and management of BitZup regarding their
            individual and collective responsibilities in combating financial
            crimes. This includes providing clear guidance on recognizing
            suspicious activities, adhering to customer due diligence (CDD)
            protocols, maintaining adequate records, and monitoring and
            submitting suspicious transactions to the authorities in a timely
            and compliant manner. The policy ensures that the Bitzup platform
            operates with the highest standards of transparency, integrity, and
            regulatory compliance, safeguarding the platform from being misused

          BitZup is a registered and regulated listed business under the laws of
          Trinidad and Tobago, operating in accordance with the regulatory
          requirements set forth by the authorities and in compliance with the
          Proceeds of Crime Act, the Anti-Terrorism Act, and other applicable
          AML/CFT legislation. As part of its legal obligations, BitZup is
          required to establish, implement, and maintain a robust internal
          Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CFT)
          compliance program. This includes developing comprehensive policies,
          procedures, and controls designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the
          risks associated with money laundering, terrorism financing, and other
          financial crimes. BitZup is also mandated to promptly identify and
          report any suspicious transactions to the competent authorities of
          Trinidad and Tobago, in accordance with statutory reporting
          obligations. Furthermore, the company must appoint a qualified
          Compliance Officer (AML Officer) who is responsible for overseeing the
          implementation of AML/CFT measures, ensuring ongoing regulatory
          compliance, and serving as the primary liaison with the enforcement
          bodies. BitZup is also obligated to conduct regular AML/CFT training
          programs for all relevant employees, ensuring that staff are aware of
          financial crime risks, red flags, and their responsibilities in
          maintaining compliance. In addition, the company is required to
          maintain accurate and detailed records of all customer due diligence
          (CDD), transactions, and reports for a minimum period of six (6)
          years, in accordance with data retention and regulatory requirements,
          to facilitate audits, investigations, and regulatory reviews.

          3. CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE (CDD)
        </div>
        <div className="text-left font-normal text-[15px] leading-8">
          BitZup will implement a comprehensive, risk-based approach to Know
          Your Customer (KYC) and Customer Due Diligence (CDD) procedures,
          either directly or through qualified third-party service providers.
          This process is designed to effectively assess and mitigate the risks
          of money laundering, terrorism financing, and other financial crimes
          in compliance with the laws of Trinidad and Tobago. As part of the
          KYC/CDD process, we will conduct thorough identity verification for
          each customer, which includes collecting and verifying key
          identification details such as full name, date of birth, residential
          address, and valid government-issued identification, including a
          national ID or passport. Additionally, we will assess and verify the
          source of funds and the intended purpose of the transaction to ensure
          that the customer’s financial activities are legitimate and consistent
          with their profile. For customers identified as presenting a higher
          risk—such as Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), individuals
          transacting with offshore wallets, or those involved in large or
          unusual cryptocurrency transactions—we will apply Enhanced Due
          Diligence (EDD) measures. This includes deeper scrutiny of their
          financial background, source of wealth, and transaction behaviour.
          Furthermore, we will establish systems for the ongoing monitoring of
          all customer transactions to detect any unusual, inconsistent, or
          suspicious activities over the course of the customer relationship.
          This continuous monitoring ensures that the company remains vigilant
          and proactive in identifying and addressing financial crime risks as
          they arise.

          4. Periodic Re-KYC Updation
        </div>
        <div className="text-left font-normal text-[15px] leading-8">
          As part of our ongoing commitment to maintaining strong Anti-Money
          Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CFT) controls, our
          company implements a structured process for conducting periodic Know
          Your Customer (KYC) reviews, also referred to as Re-KYC. These reviews
          are designed to ensure that the customer information we hold remains
          accurate, complete, and up to date throughout the duration of the
          business relationship. The frequency and depth of these Re-KYC
          assessments are directly determined by the customer’s assigned risk
          category, which is established during the initial onboarding process
          and continuously evaluated through ongoing monitoring. Customers are
          classified into risk levels such as low, medium, or high risk based on
          factors including their geographic location, nature of business,
          transaction patterns, involvement in high-risk sectors, status as a
          Politically Exposed Person (PEP), and other risk indicators. For
          higher-risk customers, Re-KYC is conducted more frequently and
          involves more detailed scrutiny, while for lower-risk customers, the
          reviews occur at longer intervals with proportionate due diligence
          measures. This risk based Re-KYC framework ensures compliance with the
          laws of Trinidad and Tobago, including the requirements set by the
          local authorities, and supports our broader objective of proactively
          detecting and mitigating risks associated with money laundering,
          terrorism financing, and other financial crimes.

          records in full compliance with the regulatory requirements of
          Trinidad and Tobago and international standards, including the

          (KYC) processes—including identity verification documents, risk
          assessments, and onboarding records—will be securely stored.
          Additionally, detailed records of all transactions, including those
          subject to the FATF Travel Rule, will be maintained. This includes
          information on the originators and beneficiaries involved in digital
          asset transfers to ensure traceability and transparency in

          be preserved. These records will be stored for a minimum period of six
          (6) years following the completion of the transaction or the
          termination of the business relationship, whichever is later, in
          accordance with the requirements of the Proceeds of Crime Act, the
          Anti-Terrorism Act, and directives from the authorities of Trinidad
          and Tobago. This robust record-keeping framework ensures that the

          money laundering, terrorism financing, and other financial crimes.

          8. TRANSACTION MONITORING & REPORTING
        </div>
        <div className="text-left font-normal text-[15px] leading-8">
          The company will implement a comprehensive transaction monitoring
          system that includes both real-time surveillance and post-facto
          (retrospective) monitoring to effectively identify unusual,
          suspicious, or potentially high-risk patterns of behaviour or
          transactions. Real-time monitoring allows the company to flag and
          review transactions as they occur, providing an immediate response to
          any activity that deviates from the customer’s expected profile or
          presents indicators of money laundering, terrorism financing, or other
          financial crimes. Post-facto monitoring complements this by enabling
          detailed reviews of historical transactions to detect patterns or
          anomalies that may not have been immediately apparent.
        </div>
        <div className="text-left font-normal text-[15px] leading-8">
          Upon identifying a suspicious transaction, the company will adhere
          strictly to its legal obligation to prepare and submit suspicious
          transactions to the authorities of Trinidad and Tobago, ensuring that
          this reporting process is conducted confidentially. Under no
          circumstances will the client be informed, directly or indirectly,
          that a report has been or will be filed, as doing so would constitute
          tipping off, which is prohibited under the Proceeds of Crime Act and
          the Anti-Terrorism Act.
        </div>
        <div>
          Additionally, the company will maintain a secure and detailed

          Financing (CFT) obligations, in accordance with the regulatory
          framework of Trinidad and Tobago. These policies will cover all
          critical aspects of compliance, including customer due diligence
          (CDD), ongoing transaction monitoring, sanctions screening, risk
          assessment, reporting of suspicious activities, and record-keeping
          requirements. To ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the AML/CFT
          framework, the company will conduct thorough, independent audits on an
          annual basis. These audits will assess the adequacy of the compliance
          program, identify gaps or weaknesses, and recommend corrective
          measures where needed. Furthermore, the company will implement a
          robust compliance and audit framework that facilitates continuous
          review, testing, and enhancement of its systems and controls. This
          process includes regularly evaluating the performance of AML/CFT
          procedures, KYC processes, and transaction monitoring tools to ensure
          they remain effective against evolving financial crime risks. Any
          updates in regulations, advisories, or changes in international best
          practices will be promptly incorporated into the company’s compliance
          framework to maintain alignment with current legal requirements and to
