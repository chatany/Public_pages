            Digital Asset trading is subject to severe market risk and price
            volatility. Changes in value may be significant and may occur
            rapidly and without warning. Past performance is not in any way an
            indicator of future performance. The value of an investment and any
            returns can go down as well as up. You may not get back the amount
            you have invested, and there is severe risk of losing all of your
            assets.

            BitZup does not guarantee uninterrupted availability of its services
            at any specific time, nor does it ensure that the platform will be
            free from unexpected outages or network congestion. As a result,
            there may be times when you are unable to buy, sell, store,
            transfer, send, or receive Digital Assets as intended. In cases
            where a Digital Asset project undergoes bankruptcy, liquidation, or
            dissolution, violates applicable laws and regulations, or if
            requested by the project party, BitZup may delist the associated
            Digital Asset. Such actions could lead to potential losses for
            Users. Due to legal and regulatory constraints in various
            jurisdictions, certain BitZup products, services, or platform
            functionalities may be restricted or unavailable in specific regions
            or to certain Users. Consequently, any BitZup marketing campaigns,
            promotions, or activities are not intended for or directed at Users
            subject to such restrictions. Users are solely responsible for
